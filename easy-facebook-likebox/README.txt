Easy Social Feed helps you display your latest **Instagram photos, videos and Facebook page posts, albums, photos, videos and events** on your website. It is responsive, SEO-friendly, easy to set up and offers live preview customization for appearance and layout.


Connect your account using the latest secure oAuth login and get a shortcode auto-generated. No app review required. Manual access token support is also available for Personal or Business accounts.

You can enable only the module you need (Facebook or Instagram) so unrelated code is not loaded, improving performance.

And, it looks beautiful as can be seen on my page.
Thank you for making this plugin!"* - [sayhi2lonnie](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/this-plugin-rocks-61/)

### GDPR & cookie consent compatibility

Easy Social Feed includes a global GDPR mode that works automatically with the most popular **WordPress cookie consent and GDPR banner plugins**. When a supported cookie plugin is active, the feed will respect your visitors’ consent before loading Facebook or Instagram media, helping you stay compliant with privacy regulations.

Out of the box, the plugin integrates seamlessly with these top cookie / GDPR solutions:

- Real Cookie Banner by devowl.io  
- GDPR Cookie Compliance by Moove Agency  
- Cookie Notice by dFactory  
- GDPR Cookie Consent by WebToffee  
- CookieYes | GDPR Cookie Consent by CookieYes  
- Cookiebot by Cybot A/S  
- Complianz by Really Simple Plugins  
- Borlabs Cookie by Borlabs  
- WPConsent by the WPConsent team  

Whether you search for an **“Instagram GDPR feed”**, **“Facebook GDPR feed”**, or **“cookie consent friendly social feed plugin”**, Easy Social Feed is built to plug into your existing consent setup instead of replacing it.

3. Go to Easy Social Feed > Facebook / Instagram to connect your account

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I connect my Facebook account to the plugin? =
Navigate to Easy Social Feed > Facebook in your WordPress dashboard. Click on "Connect My Facebook Account" button. A modal will appear explaining the required permissions. Click "Connect to Facebook" and follow the authorization process. Make sure to select your Business Manager and grant all requested permissions for the plugin to work properly.

= How do I connect my Instagram account? =
Go to Easy Social Feed > Instagram in your WordPress dashboard. Click "Connect My Instagram Account" and choose between two connection types:
- **Business Basic**: For simple Instagram feeds from professional accounts
- **Business Advanced**: For advanced features like hashtag feeds, mentions, and multiple account management

Follow the connection wizard to complete the setup.

= What's the difference between Instagram Business Basic and Business Advanced? =
**Business Basic** is perfect for displaying your Instagram posts and stories with basic permissions. **Business Advanced** requires connecting your Instagram account to a Facebook Page and provides access to hashtag feeds, mentions feeds, multiple accounts, and advanced insights. Choose based on your needs.

= Why is my feed not displaying or showing "No posts available"? =
This usually happens when:
- Your access token has expired. Reconnect your account from the plugin settings.
- Required permissions were not granted during connection. Reconnect and ensure all permissions are enabled.
- Your Instagram account is not a Professional (Business or Creator) account for Business connections.
- Cache needs to be cleared. Go to plugin settings and clear the cache.

= How do I display the feed on my website? =
After connecting your account:
1. Go to the "Use (Display)" tab in the plugin settings
2. Use the shortcode generator to create your custom shortcode
3. Copy the generated shortcode
4. Paste it into any page, post, or widget area
You can also use the dedicated widget from Appearance > Widgets or use WordPress blocks.

= Can I customize the look and feel of my feed? =
Yes! The plugin includes a powerful real-time customizer. Navigate to the "Customize" or "Skins" section where you can:
- Change colors, fonts, and spacing
- Adjust number of columns and layout
- Enable/disable specific elements
- Create multiple skins for different pages
All changes are previewed in real-time using WordPress Customizer.

= How do I display multiple feeds on my site? =
Simply generate different shortcodes for each feed you want to display. You can:
- Use different Instagram accounts
- Display different Facebook pages
- Apply different skins/layouts
- Place feeds on multiple pages
There's no limitation on the number of feeds you can create.

= Why do I need to connect my Instagram to a Facebook Page? =
For Business Advanced connections, Facebook requires Instagram Business accounts to be connected to a Facebook Page. This is a Meta/Facebook requirement, not a plugin limitation. This connection enables advanced features like hashtag feeds and better API access.

= How often does the feed update? =
The plugin uses smart caching to optimize performance. You can configure the cache duration in the settings:
- Minimum recommended: 6 hours
- Default: 12-24 hours
- You can manually clear cache anytime from the settings
This helps reduce API calls and improves your site's loading speed.

= Can I display feeds from accounts I don't own? =
- No only feeds from accounts you own and have connected

= What permissions does the plugin need and why? =
**Facebook Permissions:**
- pages_read_engagement: To read posts and content
- pages_read_user_content: To display your page content
- business_management: To access Business Manager accounts
- pages_show_list: To list available pages

**Instagram Permissions:**
- instagram_business_basic: Basic profile and posts access
- instagram_basic: Profile information
- instagram_manage_insights: Account metrics and statistics
- pages_show_list: To list connected Instagram accounts

These permissions are read-only and don't allow the plugin to post or modify your content.

= The feed is loading slowly. How can I fix this? =
1. Enable caching in the plugin settings (recommended: 12-24 hours)
2. Optimize the number of posts loaded initially
3. Use "Load More" button instead of displaying all posts at once
4. Ensure your hosting has good performance

= Can I display Instagram Stories? =
Yes! Instagram Stories are supported. Make sure you're using a Business connection and have the necessary permissions. Stories are automatically included in your feed and will be displayed for 24 hours as per Instagram's policy.

= How do I display Instagram Hashtag or Mentions feeds? =
Hashtag and Mentions feeds require the Business Advanced connection. After connecting:
1. Go to the Moderate or Feeds section
2. Select "Hashtag" or "Mentions" as the feed type
3. Enter your hashtag or mentions
4. Generate and use the shortcode

= Is the plugin GDPR compliant? =
Yes, the plugin is GDPR compliant. It only fetches public data that you've authorized. No personal data from your site visitors is collected or sent to third parties. The plugin caches content on your server to minimize external API calls.

= Does the plugin work with page builders? =
Yes! The plugin works with all major page builders including:
- Gutenberg (WordPress Block Editor)
- Elementor
- WPBakery
- Divi
- Beaver Builder
Simply paste the shortcode in a text/shortcode widget or use the dedicated blocks if available.

= Why am I getting "API Rate Limit" errors? =
API rate limits are set by Facebook/Instagram. To minimize this:
- Increase cache duration in settings
- Reduce the frequency of feed updates
- Don't use too many feeds from the same account
- The plugin uses smart caching to help prevent rate limit issues

= How do I display the feed in a popup? =
The plugin includes built-in popup functionality:
- Posts automatically open in an elegant popup when clicked
- Navigate between posts using next/previous arrows
- Pro version includes advanced popup with Instagram-like experience
No additional configuration needed - it works out of the box!

= Can I filter posts by type (photos, videos, etc.)? =
Yes, with the Pro version you can filter Facebook posts by:
- Photos only
- Videos only
- Events only
- Status updates only
Use the shortcode generator to select your preferred post types.
